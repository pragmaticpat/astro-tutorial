## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project ans set up my online accounts.
1. **Making pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `./src/pages/` folder
1. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next?

will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come!
